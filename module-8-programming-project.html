// NOTE: You must implement the data structures using the prototype approach.
//       This is not what the book uses, so you have to convert it.
//       See also: https://it.pointpark.edu/tutorials/no-prototype-vs-prototype/

// 1. What is the worst case complexity of the following function?

function hasDuplicates(arr) {
  for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (var j = 0; j < arr.length; j++) {
      if (i !== j && arr[i] === arr[j]) {
        return true;
      }
    }
  }
  return false;
}

// 2. Implement a faster version of the same function and analyze the
//    complexity of this approach.

function hasDuplicatesFast(arr) {
  // todo
}

// 3. The travelling salesman problem is a another classic problem and we are
//    going to solve it using a greedy algorithm. Before starting, please read
//    through the article on Wikipedia:
//      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem
//    Then implement the following:
//    (a) Create a graph that represents the example symmetric TSP problem on
//        the Wikipedia page.
//    (b) Implement a greedy search that finds the shortest path. You should
//        have the following steps: (1) pick node A as the starting position,
//        (2) pick the closest neighbor that has not been visited as the next
//        city to visit, (3) continue this process until returning to A,
//        (4) print the final length of the path and also the sequence of
//        the cities.
//    (c) Check your results, do they make sense? Is is the optimal solution?

// 4. Solve https://csacademy.com/contest/interview-archive/task/intersecting-rectangles/
//    What is the runtime complexity of your solution?
//    HINT: Try to break down the problems into smaller steps. For example,
//          find a convenient way to represent rectangles and define a function
//          that tests whether one rectangle is inside another. Then test your
//          code on just two rectangles first to make sure it works.
